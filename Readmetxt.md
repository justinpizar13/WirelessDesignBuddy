First we set up our Dev Environment.

We installed Node.js and npm already. (node -v and npm -v in the terminal to check version)

ChatGPT reccomended React + Tailwind CSS + Vite.
React handles complex UI and state (APs, walls, power levels)
Tailwind CSS makes building good-looking UIs fast.
Vite is a modern dev server for React.

Created a project using the React framework and typescript.

cd ~/wireless-designer to get to our project folder.
jupizarr@JUPIZARR-M-4M76 wireless-designer % npm run dev     to run the web app.
http://localhost:5173/ to access it.
